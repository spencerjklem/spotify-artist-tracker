# Spotify Artist Tracker
Creates playlist of all released music from given artists in past week


## How To Run
Go to [spotify for developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) to create an app. This will provide you with a Client ID and Cient Secret. You will then replace these where it is specified in the program, as well as replace where it asks for a port with an open port (such as 1234 or 8888). 

Create a new empty playlist on your spotify, and get its playlist id. Copy the link to the playlist and it is in that link
