# Spotify Artist Tracker
Creates playlist of all released music from given artists in past week

## How To Run
Go to [spotify for developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) to create an app. This will provide you with a Client ID and Cient Secret. You will then replace these where it is specified in the program, as well as replace where it asks for a port with an open port (such as 1234 or 8888). 
Lastly, you will need to create a new empty playlist on your spotify, and get its playlist id. You can do this by copy the link to the playlist and in that link the ID is right in between the / and ?. See below for more details
